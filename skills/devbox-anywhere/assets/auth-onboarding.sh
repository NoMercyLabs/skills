# Login onboarding for the devbox. Answers one question on the first terminal of a container:
# "which of the logins this project needs are not set up yet, and what do I type to fix each?"
#
# WHAT IT READS: DEVBOX_AUTH, a comma-separated list of tool NAMES (e.g. "git,gh,docker") set in
# docker-compose.yml when the box is generated. Names only. No secret, token, key, or credential is
# ever passed in, read out, stored, or transmitted by this script - it asks each tool "are you
# signed in?", prints yes or no, and exits. The user then signs in themselves, inside the box.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS: a fresh container has none of the host's logins. Without this, the user finds out
# by hitting a failure mid-task - a push that 403s, a CLI that exits 1 with no explanation. This
# turns that into a checklist on the first terminal, before any work starts.
#
# HOW TO EXTEND: add a case to check() and the matching case to fix(). Keep every check cheap and
# offline-tolerant - this runs on the first terminal of every container, and a check that hangs on
# a network timeout makes the whole editor feel broken.
